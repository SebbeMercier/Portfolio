# Gemini Project Analysis Report

**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Project:** Sebbe Mercier Portfolio
**Framework:** React 19 (via Create React App), React Router v7
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI

## 1. Executive Summary
The project is a modern, feature-rich portfolio application built with React. However, it currently faces a critical stability issue likely caused by the incompatibility between **React 19** and **react-scripts (Create React App)**. The "server starting in the void" (blank screen or hang) is a known symptom of this mismatch, as `react-scripts` v5 relies on Webpack configurations that are not fully optimized for React 19's new concurrent features and hooking mechanisms.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### Core Stack
*   **Runtime/Build:** `react-scripts` (Create React App) - *Legacy/Deprecated*
*   **Frontend Library:** React 19.2.3 (Latest stable)
*   **Routing:** React Router v7.10.1 (Latest)
*   **State Management:** Context API (Gradient, EasterEgg, Translation contexts) + Hooks
*   **Backend/Data:** Supabase (Client-side integration)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3.4 + DaisyUI v4.12
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion, Anime.js

### Project Structure
*   **`src/components/`**: Modular UI components. High granularity (specific components for specific sections).
*   **`src/contexts/`**: Global state logic.
*   **`src/hooks/`**: Custom hooks for logic abstraction (e.g., `useTranslation`, `useAnalytics`).
*   **`src/services/`**: API interaction layer (Supabase, Email, etc.).
*   **`src/pages/`**: Route-level page components.

## 3. Critical Issues & "Server in the Void" Root Cause

### A. The React 19 vs. Create React App Conflict (High Probability)
**Issue:** You are running React 19 with `react-scripts` v5.
**Why it fails:** `react-scripts` is no longer actively maintained by the React team. It uses an older Webpack setup that often fails silently or produces runtime errors with React 19, especially regarding strict mode, hydration, and the new JSX transform.
**Symptom:** The dev server starts (`npm start`), but the browser shows a white screen, or the console throws obscure errors like `process is not defined` or hydration mismatches.

### B. Async Initialization Race Conditions
**Issue:** The `TranslationProvider` and `useAnalytics` hooks perform async operations (fetching data from Supabase) immediately upon mount.
**Risk:** If Supabase takes time to respond or fails (e.g., missing API keys), the app might render in an inconsistent state or "flash" before content appears. There is no global "Loading" barrier in `App.js` to wait for these critical services.

### C. React Router v7 Usage
**Issue:** The project uses `BrowserRouter` directly. While valid, v7 introduces a new Data Router (`createBrowserRouter`) that enables parallel data fetching and better error handling.
**Impact:** Using the legacy router with the new v7 library works, but misses performance optimizations.

## 4. Recommendations & Roadmap

### Priority 1: Fix the Server (Migration to Vite)
To resolve the "void" issue and ensure React 19 support, **migrating to Vite is widely recommended**.

1.  **Remove** `react-scripts` from `package.json`.
2.  **Install** Vite dependencies: `npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react`.
3.  **Create** `vite.config.js`.
4.  **Move** `public/index.html` to the root directory.
5.  **Update** `index.html` script source to `/src/index.js` (module type).

### Priority 2: UI & Architecture Improvements
1.  **Strict Mode Compliance:** Ensure all custom hooks (especially those manipulating DOM directly like `useAnimeOnScroll`) are safe for React 19's Strict Mode (double invocation).
2.  **Image Optimization:** The project uses standard `<img>` tags. Migrating to a simpler image handling or ensuring lazy loading is properly implemented (Vercel Image Optimization if deployed there).
3.  **Code Splitting:** Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for heavy page components (Admin, Projects) to speed up initial load.

## 5. UI Analysis (Pre-Analysis)
The UI heavily leverages **Tailwind** and **DaisyUI**.
*   **Strengths:** Modern stack, consistent theming via Tailwind.
*   **Weaknesses:** Potential "div soup" in complex components. Accessibility (ARIA labels) needs verification in custom interactive components like `InteractiveCursor` or `MagneticButton`.
